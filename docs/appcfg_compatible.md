## appcfg compatible

Verify that the app configuration is compatible with an older version

### Synopsis

Use this command to verify any backward compatible changes you are making to
an existing app platform app.

Gladly App Platform apps use the semantic versioning scheme in order to indicate
whether or not two different versions of a given app are compatible. The version
associated with a given app is specified in the app's "manifest.json" file. Please
take a look at the following for more information on semantic versioning:

https://semver.org

When ever possible changes made to an app should be backward compatible. Backward
compatibility makes it possible to introduce new app functionality where needed
without impacting existing Gladly configuration that relies on the older version.
This avoids having to perform a blanket update of all Gladly configuration when
introducing a new app version.

App Platform app compatibility is dependent on the format of the data returned
from data pulls and actions. I.e. changes made to the format of this data will
break any configuration that references the data. This means that any changes
made to the format of the data MUST only be additive. I.e. changing the names
of existing types, fields or enumerations is not backwards compatible. Changing
the type of an existing field is also not backwards compatible.

The general rule of thumb is that changes made to either the "data_schema.graphql"
or "actions_schema.graphql" files MUST only be additive in order to remain backwards
compatible.

e.g. existing version

``` GraphQL
enum OrderStatus {
    PENDING
    SHIPPED
}

type Order {
    productName: String
    quantity: Int
    status: OrderStatus
    total: Currency
}

type Query {
    order(orderNo: String!): Order
}
```

e.g. updated version

``` GraphQL
enum OrderStatus {
    PENDING
    # changing "SHIPPED" to "HAS_SHIPPED" is NOT compatible
    HAS_SHIPPED
    # adding "CANCELLED" is compatible
    CANCELLED
}

# changing the name of the "Order" type to "Orders" is NOT compatible
type Orders {
    # changing "productName" to "product" is NOT compatible
    product: String
    # deleting the "quantity" field is NOT compatible
    status: OrderStatus
    # changing the "total" field type from Currency to Float is NOT compatible
    total: Float
    # adding a field is compatible
    unitPrice: Currency
}

# adding a new type is compatible
type Customer {
    firstName: String
    lastName: String
}

type Query {
    # changing the "orderNo" input from non nullable to nullable is NOT compatible
    order(orderNo: String): Orders
    # adding a new Query field is compatible
    customer(emailAddress: String!): Customer
}
```


```
appcfg compatible [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -f, --file string   path to the app file to check for compatibility
  -h, --help          help for compatible
```

### Options inherited from parent commands
