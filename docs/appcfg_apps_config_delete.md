## appcfg apps config delete

Delete a configuration from an application

### Synopsis


Delete an app configuration from the platform. Active configurations must be deactivated before they can be deleted.

WARNING: Deleting a configuration is irreversible and can have significant side effects. All users of the deleted configuration, including any services or features dependent on it, will no longer receive data. Ensure that no critical processes depend on the configuration before proceeding. It is strongly recommended to deactivate the configuration and monitor the system for several days to confirm there are no unexpected issues before deletion.

Recommended Steps:
1. Deactivate the configuration if it's active:
  'appcfg apps config update "<configuration_name>" --deactivate'

   After deactivating the configuration, monitor the system to ensure there are no unexpected repercussions. It is recommended to wait several days to confirm that deactivating the configuration does not negatively impact any critical processes.

2. Delete the configuration:
  'appcfg apps config delete "<configuration_name>"'

appcfg apps config delete {configuration ID | configuration name} [flags]
```
