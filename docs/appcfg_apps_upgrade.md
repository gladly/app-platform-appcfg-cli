## appcfg apps upgrade

Upgrade all configurations of an application to a newer version

### Synopsis


Upgrade all configurations on a particular version of an application to a newer version, to incorporate backwards compatible changes into already created configurations with continuous service.

The new version of the application must already be installed for the upgrade to be successful. Upgrades can only apply to configurations on the same major version, and must be backwards compatible.

By specifying an existing application and its new version, this command upgrades all configurations using that application to now use the newer version of the same application. As an example, suppose you have an application, gladly.com/shopify/v1.0.0 installed, and you have two configurations for this app, one for each Shopify region, "Shopify US" and "Shopify EU". Then, a new version of the application, gladly.com/shopify/v1.2.0, is released, which incorporates a bugfix as well as some new fields returned by the Shopify API.

To upgrade the existing US and EU configurations, you would first install the new application using 'appcfg apps install', and then run 'appcfg apps upgrade gladly.com/shopify/v1.0.0 -n v1.2.0'. This would upgrade the US and EU configurations to use the new version of the application, v1.2.0. Now that these configurations are upgraded, you can create new configurations using the new version of the application, v1.2.0, to incorporate the new fields returned by the Shopify API.
