## appcfg run data-pull

Run the data pull configuration against the external system

### Synopsis


Run the data pull configuration against an external system.

Since some data pull configuration may depend on others, this command requires
that all data pull configurations are in working order. Test each individual
data pull configuration fist using the test command before attempting to run
a configuration against an external system.

Template data is specified in the "data/pull/_run_/data" folder (or a dataset
sub folder) and can include "correlationId.json", "integration.json" and 
"customer.json". Make sure not to store secrets in the "integration.json" file
but instead use the --secret command line flag for specifying secrets.


```
appcfg run data-pull [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -c, --customer string   JSON object that specifies the contents of the "customer" template data attribute
  -d, --data-set string   name of the data set to use for the run; data sets are located in
                          sub folders of "data/pull/_run_/data"
  -h, --help              help for data-pull
  -s, --secrets string    JSON object that specifies the contents of the "integration.secrets" template data attribute
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -o, --output string   where to output run results; one of all, console, file, none; file output
                        can be found in "_run_/output/[timestamp]" (default "console")
  -r, --root string     root folder for the app configuration; alternatively set the
                        GLADLY_APP_CFG_ROOT environment variable
```
