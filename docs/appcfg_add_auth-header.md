## appcfg add auth-header

Create an HTTP authentication header template and supporting folders

### Synopsis


Creates an {auth header name}.gtpl template placeholder as well as supporting 
test files in "authentication/headers".

Auth headers are general headers and apply to all of the app's action and
data pull REST calls. A common type of auth header is one that specifies
credentials that are required in order to execute a REST call against
the external system.

This template has access to the following template data attributes:
- correlationId
- integration

Take a look in the "authentication/headers/_test_/data" folder for examples of
the template data attributes mentioned above. Each example is in a file named 
"{attribute name}.json". You will use this data for testing and verifying the 
output of the header template.
