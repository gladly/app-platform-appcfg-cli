## appcfg add oauth-header

Create an OAuth request header template and supporting folders

### Synopsis


Creates an OAuth "{header name}.gtpl" template placeholder as well as supporting test files in "authentication/oauth/{auth_code | access_token | request_token}/headers". Specify the OAuth request (one of auth_code, access_token or request_token) for which you would like to create the header. The list of available requests will depend on the OAuth grant type that is associated with this app.

OAuth headers are typically used for specifying credentials.

This template has access to the following template data attributes:
- correlationId
- integration

Take a look in the "authentication/oauth/{auth_code | access_token | request_token}/headers/_test_" folder for examples of the template data attributes mentioned above. Each example is in a file named "{attribute name}.json". You will use this data for testing and verifying the output of the header template.
