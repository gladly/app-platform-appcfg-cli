## appcfg add action

Create an action configuration folder and all relevant files

### Synopsis

Creates an "actions/{action name}" folder containing placeholders for all relevant
action configuration files.

If not already present, it will also create an "actions/actions_schema.graphql" file.
You will add the action's corresponding GraphQL schema definition to this file.

The following configuration files will be created:

config.json
-----------
The config.json file contains meta data about the HTTP request for this action. This
file is populated with values that you specify via the add action command line flags.

request_url.gtpl
----------------
This template will be used to create the HTTP request URL associated with the
action. This template has access to the following template data attributes:
- correlationId
- integration
- inputs

request_body.gtpl
-----------------
This template will be used to create the HTTP request body for requests that
use the POST, PUT or PATCH method. The format of the output for this template
must match the "contentType" format specified in the "config.json" file.This
template has access to the following template data attributes:
- correlationId
- integration
- inputs
 
response_transformation.gtpl
----------------------------
The Gladly app platform supports data formatted using the JSON format. If
the external system already returns data in JSON that conforms to the desired
format then you do not need to create a response transformation template.
Simply provide a definition of the data structure in the "actions_schema.graphql"
file. Otherwise you will need to create a template that will transform the raw
JSON response in to the desired data format.

This template has access to the following template data attributes:
- correlationId
- integration
- inputs
- rawData (object representing the JSON response data; this is the data you will transform)
- request (HTTP request data)
- response (HTTP response data)

Take a look in the "actions/{action name}/_test_/data" folder for examples of the
template data attributes mentioned above. Each example is in a file  named
"{attribute name}.json". You will use this data for testing and verifying the
output of the various templates that you define.
