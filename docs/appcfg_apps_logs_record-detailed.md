## appcfg apps logs record-detailed

Start or stop recording of detailed logs for a configuration

### Synopsis


Start or stop recording of detailed logs for a given configuration. Detailed logging captures the HTTP requests and responses involved in a GraphQL request to an app configuration.

How to Use:

1. Run this command without flags to start detailed logging and gather more information about your GraphQL requests. Once active, it remains enabled for 12 hours by default, after which it automatically deactivates.
2. Re-run this command before the 12 hours elapse if you need more time, or use the --stop flag to stop recording detailed logs once you've gathered enough information.

Caution:
Detailed logging records all incoming external data, which can be substantial. This can impact the performance of the app configuration and any systems that rely on its data. Use it only when diagnosing issues and disable it once the problem is resolved.

Next Steps:

* After activating detailed logging, use "appcfg apps logs list" to retrieve your GraphQL logs.
* Then, use "appcfg apps logs detail" to view the captured requests and responses in detail.

By following these steps, you can isolate and resolve issues more efficiently while maintaining system performance when detailed logging is not required.
