## appcfg-docs add data-pull-header

Create a data pull HTTP header template and supporting folders

### Synopsis


Creates a {data pull header name}.gtpl template placeholder as well as supporting 
test files in "data/pull/{data pull name}/headers".

A data pull header is specific to a given data pull. Headers that are general and
apply to all of the app's REST calls should be created as auth headers.

This template has access to the following template data attributes:
- correlationId
- integration
- customer

Take a look in the "data/pull/{data pull name}/headers/_test_/data" folder for
examples of the template data attributes mentioned above. Each example is in a 
file named "{attribute name}.json". You will use this data for testing and 
verifying the output of the header template.
