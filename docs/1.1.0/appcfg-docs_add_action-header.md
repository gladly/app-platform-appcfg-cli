## appcfg-docs add action-header

Create an action HTTP header template and supporting folders

### Synopsis


Creates an {action header name}.gtpl template placeholder as well as supporting 
test files in "actions/{action name}/headers".

An action header is specific to a given action. Headers that are general and
apply to all of the app's REST calls should be created as auth headers.

This template has access to the following template data attributes:
- correlationId
- integration
- inputs

Take a look in the "actions/{action name}/headers/_test_/data" folder for examples
of the template data attributes mentioned above. Each example is in a file named 
"{attribute name}.json". You will use this data for testing and verifying the 
output of the header template.
